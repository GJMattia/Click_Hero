## About Development

- My goal in developing Click Hero was to enhance my web development skills by utilizing CSS animation and JavaScript to create an simple, yet polished browser game. Additionally, I initially experimented with integrating a back-end database for score storage but ultimately found that leveraging browser localStorage provided a more efficient and seamless solution.
